# TODO Items

## High Priority
- [x] ✅ **Fix Sequoia compatibility** - AppleScript permissions too restrictive, switched to pure Shortcuts approach
- [ ] **Fix create_project function** - The brain-manager create_project automation failed during initial setup. Need to investigate why directory creation and GitHub integration didn't work properly.

## Medium Priority  
- [ ] **Test script with actual Voice Control** - Verify the AppleScript works correctly with macOS Voice Control
- [ ] **Add error handling** - Handle cases where Obsidian vault doesn't exist or permissions are denied
- [ ] **Create installation script** - Automate the Voice Control command setup process

## Low Priority
- [ ] **Add audio file support** - Option to save the original audio alongside text transcription  
- [ ] **Template variations** - Different entry formats for different types of logs
- [ ] **Tag support** - Auto-tag entries with project names or categories
- [ ] **Export functionality** - Convert logs to different formats (PDF, CSV, etc.)

## Completed
- [x] ✅ **Fix Sequoia compatibility** - Used "Get File from Path" action for proper file handling
- [x] ✅ **Fix vault path** - Updated AppleScript to use correct ~/Documents/Obsidian/ location
- [x] ✅ **Create project structure** - Basic files and documentation complete
- [x] ✅ **Push to GitHub** - Repository created and accessible
